            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Introducing Flame AI: A cutting-edge early fire detection system poised to revolutionize safety protocols. Equipped with advanced technology, Flame AI swiftly notifies first responders and administrators of fire outbreaks while providing crucial data on surrounding populations, enabling optimal resource allocation and swift rescue operations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>Our inspiration for this project ignited when one of our team members shared a personal story: their father experienced firsthand the devastating impact of a factory fire, leading to the shutdown of an entire workspace. This event propelled us to delve deeper into similar occurrences across various settings – from workplaces to homes, labs, and classrooms. Our research uncovered a pervasive issue: existing smoke detector systems, utilized in 90% of American households, often prove unreliable, either failing to detect fires until after they've erupted or triggering false alarms. Furthermore, the lack of actionable data leaves responders ill-prepared, with no insight into resource allocation or prioritization within affected buildings.</p>

                    <div class="how-built">
                        <h3>Website</h3>
                        <p>The front-end of our website was built using HTML for website structure and elements, CSS for style, and JavaScript was used for dynamic elements. The JQuery library was utilized for updating HTML text and information across our site during event handling.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The frontend displays multiple live camera feeds that display the people and fire(s) present</li>
                            <li>It also allows the user to enter information for the logistic regression model to determine if fire smoke is present</li>
                            <li>If any of the camera feeds is displayed with fire, text and email alerts are sent to effected individuals</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Backend:</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Our backend infrastructure is a testament to our commitment to harnessing cutting-edge technologies for seamless integration and optimal performance. At its core lies Flask, a lightweight and versatile micro-framework, which serves as the foundation for our web application. Leveraging Flask's flexibility, we have seamlessly integrated [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/) to facilitate real-time streaming and processing of live video feeds. This integration allows us to connect multiple PyTorch models, empowering our system with advanced computer vision capabilities for fire detection and analysis.

                        - The use of [socket.io](http://socket.io) allows us to collect and process real time image data. The high speed image collection that this framework allows us to do results in our model’s speed being the limited factor. Therefore, out of the 60 frames we get in a second, only 10 are run through the image processor in order to limit latency and outdated data. To the human eye and the early warning detection system, these 10 frames per second are more than enough to gather meaningful data from — and it looks (and still is) real time!

                        In addition to these sophisticated functionalities, Flask serves as the conduit for integrating a Scikit-learn linear regression model, enhancing our backend with predictive analytics capabilities. This amalgamation of technologies enables us to deliver a comprehensive solution that extends beyond basic rendering of web pages.

                        Moreover, our backend boasts a robust system of endpoints tailored to meet diverse user needs. For instance, users can leverage POST requests to input sensor data, which is then processed by our machine learning model to predict fire occurrences. This predictive functionality not only enhances user engagement but also reinforces our commitment to leveraging data science for proactive risk management.

                        - `/predict` is a POST request that allows the website to post sensor data to the server and receive a binary output on whether the sensor indicates that there is a fire. This is determined by running the inputs through the aforementioned Scikit-Learn model.

                        Furthermore, our backend system features a comprehensive suite of GET and POST endpoints dedicated to live video feed image processing. This allows users to access specific data points in real-time, enabling enhanced visualization and analysis of critical information.

                        <h3>Models</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Model 1:</strong> YOLOv5 base - Using PyTorch, we utilized the base pre-trained YOLOv5 model to detect people in the camera frame</li>
                            <li><strong>Model 2:</strong> YOLOv5 fine-tuned - We gathered and formatted Kaggle and Roboflow datasets of fire images. Across the data we had over 9000 labeled images with and without fire. These images were split into a 85-5-10 train, test, validation split. We then used PyTorch to fine-tune the base model with the fire images across 3 epochs. 3 epochs were used as we had limited computing power and time to complete training</li>
                            <li><strong>Model 3:</strong> Smoke Prediction Logistic Regression Model - Using SkiKit-Learn and a smoke detection dataset, we created a model to predict whether there is fire smoke in the air or not. The dataset contained data about the temperature, humidity, volatile organic compounds, carbon dioxide levels, and air pressure to accurately predict smoke occurrences. We used a 90-10 train-test split with over 62,000 data points. The model was saved using Joblib and utilized in the website. Visualizations of the model’s performance can be seen on the website and below.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The three models work in parallel to determine if there is a fire present. Together they use a threshold of 0.65 to conclude that there is a fire.</p>
                        <p>If a fire is detected, students, administrators, and first responders such as firefighters can be alerted about the situation. To accomplish this, we used Python’s built in Simple Mail Transfer Protocol library to send email and SMS notifications with information regarding the presence of a fire and how many people were detected to all of our phones, and can be specified to any recipient. Based off of this information first-responders, administrators, and students can respond accordingly. The continuous data detailing the location of the fire and people can be especially useful to first responders in their rescue efforts.</p>

                    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
                    <p>Buildings on campus such as The Kendeda Building currently have sensors that collect data corresponding to many of the parameters of the smoke detection model which we could implement to actually be useful in case of a fire in the building. Once this data is gathered, a more comprehensive map that displays the location of people and fire in the building (as shown on the website) can be further populated to help first responders. Looking ahead, we plan to integrate the detection of flammable objects, and incorporating map location functionality will provide users with a comprehensive overview of fire incidents in their vicinity. Additionally, we aim to implement features that offer exit instructions or send notifications to nearby individuals.</p>
